## Overview

This aim is to use CoreData to develop a dynamic Master/Detail app with persistent data.  The app's purpose is to maintain a list of my favourite locations, complete with descriptions and images. Persistent data is used to implement a Master/Detail view. Various locations are listed in the Master View.  The name of the place and a thumbnail preview of the photograph are displayed next to each entry in the list (item). You can add, remove, and edit components in the detail View in its entirety. The navigation view contains the list. Each item has a Navigation Link embedded in it that can be clicked (or touched) to get a Detail View. The image (or its URL if editing mode is active), name, location, and description are all displayed in the Detail View.  The description and picture URLs are just two of the totally changeable sections.  The upper left corner of the Detail View also features a back button that returns the user to the Master View and often displays the name of the list.
